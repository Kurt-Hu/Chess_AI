Hi! My name is Kurt and this is the code repository for the Chess AI that I developed for my senior project.

I used the p5.js library to code this, and implemented the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning enabled. There are still many improvements and bug fixes to be had in the future, but this establishes a baseline level AI that can play against itself or against a human player. Good luck and have fun!
